# CAD models for the transceiver case
- `antenna_base.*` - antenna foundation, antenna spiral widing is done with 1.3mm copper solid wire on 8mm diameter scaffolding, ~8 turns with 6mm step, with this configuration resonance will be at around 400 MHz, cut with small 2-4mm incriments to move resonance to higher frequency (e.g. to desired 433 or 446 MHz), control resonance after each step with antenna analyzer when antenna cover is attached.
- `antenna_cover_short.*` - antenna cover for 433 MHz (TPU plastic is preferred).
- `base.*` - model for the base part of the case where board is inserted.
- `upper.*` - upper part of the case with battery compartment.
- `upper_no_battery.*` - upper part of the case without battery compartment.
- `knob.*` - rotary encoder knob (TPU plastic is preferred).
- `ptt.*` - PTT button cover (TPU plastic is preferred).
- `battery_lid.*` - battery compartment lid.
